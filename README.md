Digital Carbon Footprint Tracker

This project is a personalized dashboard that calculates and visualizes the carbon emissions generated by a userâ€™s digital activities such as emails sent, cloud storage usage, and GitHub commits. It helps users understand the environmental impact of their online actions, track trends over time, and identify their top emission sources. By providing clear insights and visual graphs, it encourages greener digital habits and promotes awareness of the often-overlooked environmental cost of everyday digital behavior.
